# Mall Customer Clustering

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to clustering Mall customers based on their annual income and spending score. Three clustering algorithms, namely K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBScan, are applied to group customers with similar characteristics.

## Repository Contents

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Understand the features and distribution of the Mall customer dataset.

2. **K-means Clustering:**
   - Apply the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups based on income and spending score.

3. **Hierarchical Clustering:**
   - Utilize Hierarchical Clustering to form a hierarchy of clusters and visualize the dendrogram.

4. **DBScan Clustering:**
   - Implement DBScan to discover clusters based on density, effectively identifying outliers.

## Instructions

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Ensure the Mall customer dataset is available and structured with annual income and spending score.

2. **K-means Clustering:**
   - Run the K-means clustering script to observe the segmentation of customers.

3. **Hierarchical Clustering:**
   - Execute the Hierarchical Clustering script to visualize the dendrogram and identify optimal clusters.

4. **DBScan Clustering:**
   - Run the DBScan clustering script to identify clusters based on density.

5. **Results and Visualization:**
   - Review the generated visualizations and insights from each clustering algorithm.
